# Computer_Controlled_Power_Supply
## Electronic Research Project - Department of Physics and Electronics - University of Kelaniya.

This is a computer controlled power supply that operate using GUI. Using this power supply, user can get varyable voltage upto 12V. And also resistor values can be measured and get I-V characteristics curves of the electronic components like resistors, diodes and transistors can be ploted. GUI is used to set all the command and see all the outputs(measured values and I-V curves). This device include short circuits and overcurrent protection and all the parts controlled by ATmega328 microcontroller. I have used c# to create the GUI and Arduino to program the microcontroller. And all the circuit diagrams are include here.
