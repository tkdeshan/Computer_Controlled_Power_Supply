# Computer_Controlled_Power_Supply
### Electronics Research Project - Department of Physics and Electronics - University of Kelaniya.

This power supply can be operated using a graphical user interface (GUI). With this power supply, users can obtain variable voltages up to 12 V with 0.1 V resolution. Additionally, it allows for the measurement of resistor values and the plotting of I-V characteristics curves for electronic components such as resistors, diodes, and transistors. It can also be known as a source measure unit because it is capable of both sourcing and measuring. The GUI is used to set commands and view outputs, including measured values and I-V curves. The device includes short circuit and overcurrent protection, and all the components are controlled by an ATmega328 microcontroller. C# is used to create the GUI and Arduino is used to program the microcontroller.
